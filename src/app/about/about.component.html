          <h5> Since 2008, the homeowners of Mill Creek have managed the community affairs through a volunteer homeowner elected board of directors,
            consisting of five homeowner representatives. As fellow homeowners, we share the same passion to ensure that our investment in our homes is managed
            properly while protecting and preserving the rights of our neighbors within the community.
